In this blog, I will try to share my journey to the Kubernetes land.

## Why this blog?

To have a real use case to test a kubernetes deployment.
The goal is to simulate a production deployment and to test how to implement solutions to real work problems in a lab environment without real availability constraints.

To start the experiment, the lab will be composed of 2 Raspberry pi nodes running k3s. A raspberry Pi 4 with 4G of memory and a Raspberry Pi 3B+. Both booting on an external USB drive of 1 Go.

## What should be covered ideally

All the tests I would like to do with this cluster :

- k3s installation
- Cluster initialisation
- How it work under the hood
- Deployment
- Rolling updates
- Logs management
- Backups
- Monitoring
- Cluster upgrade
- Deploying a distributed storage
- CI/CD
- Deployment pipeline
- ... Everything else I will think off ...
